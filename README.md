## Battle
This is how the **Escape Velocity Nova Card Game** is meant to be played. You get every single card from the race you select and have a full galactic battle between these races! Which race will come out on top?

1. Select a race for player 1  
2. Select a race for player 2  
3. Begin the battle (See [How to Play](#how-to-play-combat-101))

## Skirmish
A balanced fight! You receive **100 points** worth of randomly selected ships that will engage in battle.  

- You will usually receive **around 10 ships** for this game mode.  
- You may receive only **1 ship** (the most expensive ship costs 100 points).  
- You may receive the **entire race** (the Alien race is only around 70 points in cost, while other races have much more than 100 points worth of ships).  

### Steps:

## How to Play (Combat 101)

- **Reserves**: Holds all the ships your race has left.  
- **Ships**: Where active combat takes place.  
- **Draw**: Where you add to your **attack, defense, pursuit,** and **escape** scores.  

### Possible Attacks:
- **Fighters**: When fighters are launched, no cards are drawn.  
- **Missiles**:  
  - Each player draws **two cards**.  
  - The attacker’s cards are added to their **attack, shield (or armor), and pursuit** scores.  
  - The defender’s cards are added to their **shield (or armor) and escape** scores.  
  - If the attacker’s **pursuit** score is **greater than or equal to** the defender’s **escape** score, they **hit!**  
  - If the attacker’s **shield (or armor)** score is **greater than or equal to** the defender’s **shield (or armor)** score, they **damage (or destroy) the opponent!**  
- **Attack**:  
  - Same as **Missiles**, except each player only draws **one card**.  
  - **Pursuit and escape are irrelevant** (regular weapons always hit but don’t always deal damage).  
- **Shield Bypassing Attack**:  
  - Same as **Attack**, except it **bypasses shields** and directly attacks **armor**.
